# pokemon-deck-generator
A web application that generates a random pokemon deck 

## Description
The website generates a deck of cards based on type preference.<br>
A deck of 20 cards is displayed on the second page.<br>
<br>
As fans of Pokémon, our group felt that there was a market for creating a randomized Pokémon card generator for people who are building their own Pokémon decks. This project helped our team of four learn how to collaborate on a group project and upload our contributions in GitHub in a organized way.<br>


This web application uses two Pokémon application programming interfaces (APIs).<br>
The first Pokémon API is found here: https://pokemontcg.io/ <br>
The second Pokémon API is found here: https://www.tcgdex.dev/ <br>
This web application uses the CSS framework called Foundation found here: https://get.foundation/ <br>
